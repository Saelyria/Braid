#  Tableau Example

Welcome to the Tableau example! This is a simple app that demonstrates a few ways to use Tableau to bind your table views. This example
project can be built and run in a simulator and played with while you read through it. The example is divided into different 'sample' sections
that focus on key points. It's recommended that you do them in order, as they grow in complexity with each one. Each sample has its own
folder and README file that explains everything in them.
